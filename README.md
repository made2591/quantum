## Quantum Experiment

This repo contains a series of experiment over the IBM Q platfom: they are written following the OpenQASM 2.0 specification.

### List of experiment
The following experiments run over both simulated and real quantum computer exposed by IBM Q.

#### Simulated Environment
The following experiments run over a simulated environment made of 1 qubit quantum register e 1 bit classical register (to save the result of measurement).

- __exp_001__: this experiment let you try the ```X``` gate (Pauli transform), the equivalent of ```NOT``` gate over a single classical bit;
- __exp_002__: this experiment let you try the ```Y``` gate (Pauli transform);
- __exp_003__: this experiment let you try the ```Z``` gate (Pauli transform);
- __exp_004__: this experiment let you try the ```H``` Hadamard gate, an important gate the create the superposition;

#### Real Environment
